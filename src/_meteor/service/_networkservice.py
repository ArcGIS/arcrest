        route operation as query parameters.
        Inputs:
            stops - The set of stops loaded as network locations during analysis.
                    Stops can be specified using a simple comma / semi-colon
                    based syntax or as a JSON structure. If stops are not
                    specified, preloaded stops from the map document are used in
                    the analysis.
            barriers - The set of barriers loaded as network locations during
                       analysis. Barriers can be specified using a simple comma
                       / semi-colon based syntax or as a JSON structure. If
                       barriers are not specified, preloaded barriers from the
                       map document are used in the analysis. If an empty json
                       object is passed ('{}') preloaded barriers are ignored.
            polylineBarriers - The set of polyline barriers loaded as network
                               locations during analysis. If polyline barriers
                               are not specified, preloaded polyline barriers
                               from the map document are used in the analysis.
                               If an empty json object is passed ('{}')
                               preloaded polyline barriers are ignored.
            polygonBarriers - The set of polygon barriers loaded as network
                              locations during analysis. If polygon barriers
                              are not specified, preloaded polygon barriers
                              from the map document are used in the analysis.

                              polygon barriers are ignored.

            travelMode - Travel modes provide override values that help you
                         quickly and consistently model a vehicle or mode of
                         transportation. The chosen travel mode must be
                         preconfigured on the network dataset that the routing
                         service references.
            attributeParameterValues - A set of attribute parameter values that
                                       can be parameterized to determine which
                                       network elements can be used by a vehicle.
            returnDirections - If true, directions will be generated and returned

                                       accumulated with the analysis. The default is
                                       as defined in the network layer. The value
                                       should be specified as a comma separated list
                                       of attribute names. You can also specify a
                                       value of none to indicate that no network
                                       attributes should be accumulated.
            impedanceAttributeName - The network attribute name to be used as the
                                     impedance attribute in analysis. The default is

                                       separated list of attribute names. You can
                                       also specify a value of none to indicate that
                                       no network attributes should be used as
                                       restrictions.

        You can provide arguments to the solve service area operation as
        query parameters.
        Inputs:
            facilities - The set of facilities loaded as network locations
                         during analysis. Facilities can be specified using
                         a simple comma / semi-colon based syntax or as a
                         JSON structure. If facilities are not specified,
                         preloaded facilities from the map document are used
                         in the analysis. If an empty json object is passed
                         ('{}') preloaded facilities are ignored.
            barriers - The set of barriers loaded as network locations during
                       analysis. Barriers can be specified using a simple
                       comma/semicolon-based syntax or as a JSON structure.
                       If barriers are not specified, preloaded barriers from
                       the map document are used in the analysis. If an empty
                       json object is passed ('{}'), preloaded barriers are
                       ignored.
            polylineBarriers - The set of polyline barriers loaded as network
                               locations during analysis. If polyline barriers

                               from the map document are used in the analysis.
                               If an empty json object is passed ('{}'),
                               preloaded polyline barriers are ignored.
            polygonBarriers - The set of polygon barriers loaded as network
                              locations during analysis. If polygon barriers
                              are not specified, preloaded polygon barriers
                              from the map document are used in the analysis.

                              preloaded polygon barriers are ignored.
            travelMode - Travel modes provide override values that help you
                         quickly and consistently model a vehicle or mode of
                         transportation. The chosen travel mode must be
                         preconfigured on the network dataset that the
                         service area service references.
            attributeParameterValues - A set of attribute parameter values that
                                       can be parameterized to determine which

                        value is the departure time from the facility. The time zone
                        for timeOfDay is specified by timeOfDayIsUTC.
            timeOfDayIsUTC - The time zone or zones of the timeOfDay parameter. When
                             set to false, which is the default value, the timeOfDay
                             parameter refers to the time zone or zones in which the
                             facilities are located. Therefore, the start or end times
                             of the service areas are staggered by time zone.
            travelDirection - Options for traveling to or from the facility. The
                              default is defined in the network analysis layer.

                      geometry if the network dataset is Z-aware.

                         quickly and consistently model a vehicle or mode of
                         transportation. The chosen travel mode must be

            timeOfDay - Arrival or departure date and time. Values: specified by
                        number of milliseconds since midnight Jan 1st, 1970, UTC.
            timeOfDayIsUTC - The time zone of the timeOfDay parameter. By setting
                             timeOfDayIsUTC to true, the timeOfDay parameter refers
                             to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Choose this option
                             if you want to find what's nearest for a specific time,
                             such as now, but aren't certain in which time zone the
                             facilities or incidents will be located.
            timeOfDayUsage - Defines the way timeOfDay value is used. The default
                             is as defined in the network layer.
                             Values: esriNATimeOfDayUseAsStartTime |
                             esriNATimeOfDayUseAsEndTime
            returnZ - If true, Z values will be included in the returned routes and
                       compressed geometry if the network dataset is Z-aware.
                       The default is false.
